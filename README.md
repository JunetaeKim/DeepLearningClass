## Deep Learning Algorithms (AC5001)
Welcome to the repository for the Deep Learning Algorithms (AC5001) course, offered by the Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy(GCSP). 
This course is led by (Assistant) Professor Junetae Kim. The primary goal of this repository is to provide students with lecture notes and practical exercises. 
We are committed to facilitating an enriching learning experience by leveraging AI to understand and combat cancer.

### Course Objectives

- **Understanding Deep Learning Concepts**: Gain a solid understanding of deep learning algorithms.
- **Exercises via Google Colab**: Perform hands-on exercises using Google Colab, allowing students to execute code in a cloud-based environment without the need for local setup.

### Repository Contents

- `LectureNotes`: This folder contains all the lecture materials. Each file is named according to the lecture topic and date.
- `PracticalExercises`: Here, you'll find practical exercises designed to complement the lecture topics. These exercises are intended to be completed in Google Colab.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine or directly to Google Colab to access the course materials.
2. **Explore Lecture Notes**: Navigate through folders 'WeekN' to find the materials for each class session.
